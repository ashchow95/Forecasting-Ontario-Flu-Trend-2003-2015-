# Forecasting-Ontario-Flu-Trend-2003-2015
Utilize smoothing method, regression analysis, and box-jenkins models to forecast Ontario flu trends.
In collaboration with Jennifer Luu, Lam Diep Nguyen, Nitharshan Nithianantharajah and Suchitra Ramlakhan 

# Introduction
Using tweleve years worth of historical data, we will apply **smoothing methods**, **regression analysis**, and a **Box-Jenkins model** to find a statistical relationship in the number of people who are infected by the flu in Ontario.
The null hypothesis is that there is a decrease in number of people cathcing the flu and the alternative hypothesis is that there is an increase or no change.

Details of how the models was fitted and how each model is applied can be found in the report.
